# Code-Along-Repo of [Bryan Hansen's](https://github.com/bh5k) pluralsight course: **"Spring Framework: Authenticating Users with Spring Security"**

This repo follows every step of the pluralsight course.
But it diverges in terms of

- database (postgres instead of MySQL)
- and persistence layer (JPA instead of plain JDBC)

It is launched with this [docker-setup](https://github.com/niilz/spring-security-postgres-docker-setup)
